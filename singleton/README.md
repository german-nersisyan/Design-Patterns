# Logger with Singleton Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is often used when you need to coordinate actions across the system from a single object (e.g., logging, configuration settings, or database connections).

There are several ways to implement the Singleton Pattern, each with different trade-offs. This document covers the three most common implementations of the Singleton pattern:

1. **Lazy Singleton**
2. **Eager Singleton**
3. **Meyer's Singleton**
