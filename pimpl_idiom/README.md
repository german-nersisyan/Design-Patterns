# PImpl Idiom Variants in C++

This project demonstrates different implementations of the **PImpl** (Pointer to Implementation) idiom in C++. The goal of the project is to showcase various approaches to separating interface from implementation, improving maintainability and reducing compile-time dependencies.

## Overview

The **PImpl** (Pointer to Implementation) idiom is a C++ design pattern that helps to separate the interface of a class from its implementation. This idiom is widely used to reduce compile-time dependencies, improve binary compatibility, and hide implementation details. This repository includes several variants of the PImpl idiom, each with its own unique approach to memory management and class design.

The following PImpl variants are implemented in this project:

- **Classic PImpl**
- **Meyers PImpl**
- **Rule of Zero PImpl**
- **Smart PImpl (SPImpl)**

Each variant has its own directory with code examples demonstrating how the idiom is implemented.
